Release Notes: 2017-02-23
============================

Thanks for upgrading to the latest version of the ALKS CLI!

- The keys subcommand is now removed, enjoy the ease of using sessions
- You can now select your default account in `alks developer configure`
- You can now use your default account with sessions, just pass `-d` to bypass the account picker
- Added `alks sessions list` to list all active sessions (IAM and non-IAM)
- Account picker will now default to the last account/role you used
- Better error messaging when providing invalid accounts (`-a` / `-r`)
- Fixes bug where forcing a new session (`-N`) did not generate a new session
- You no longer have to type your password during `alks developer configure` if it hasn't changed
